# UI components

This directory contains all the low-level UI components that are used in the
dashboard. These components are only responsible for rendering the UI and
should not contain any business logic.

## Versioning

- `v1`: This folder contains old UI components that are still used in the
  dashboard. These components are deprecated and should not be used in new
  code.

- `v2`: This folder contains new UI components that are used in the dashboard. These are built on top of the [Material UI](https://mui.com/) library and shouldn't contain any Tailwind CSS classes.
